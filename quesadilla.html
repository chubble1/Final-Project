            <p>There are two defining features of a childhood in south Texas. One is the heat—and not 
                just heat, but humid heat—the kind of heat that soaks your skin with warmth and salty 
                sweat. I never had to worry about dry hands or forgetting a jacket (unless we were 
                headed to the library or the movie theater—somewhere inside where the air conditioning 
                was always on full blast). This (sometimes) wretched heat inspired many lemonade 
                stands, car washes, and afternoons inside.</p>
            <p>The second absolute of a Texan childhood is Tex Mex. There’s over 12,000 restaurants 
                in Houston, Texas these days and I’m willing to bet at least half of them serve Tex Mex. 
                Now, the phrase Tex Mex is controversial: no one really knows exactly what it means. 
                According to some, Tex Mex encompasses all Mexican food made in the United States from 
                California to Arizona to Texas. For others, Tex Mex is only Mexican food made in Texas, 
                by Texans and Tejanos.</p>            
            <p>By definition, Tex Mex has a key ingredient Mexican food does not: the peppery, smokey, 
                slightly nutty taste of cumin. Fajitas, nachos, brisket and beef enchiladas, ground beef 
                street tacos, yellow cheese; these are the makings of Tex Mex, as well as a big splash 
                of oil to cook everything in, of course.</p>
            <p>Although cumin is embedded into these dishes, cumin is usually not found in my all-time 
                favorite, Tex Mex staple: the cheese quesadilla. This Mexican cheese sandwich is flavored 
                solely by the thick, yellow cheese in the middle and the oil-soaked tortillas that flank 
                it. Not only good as an appetizer or cold from the fridge the next morning, I argue cheese 
                quesadillas make an excellent entree.</p>

        <h2>Tex Mex Home</h2>
            <p>For years, cheese quesadillas were one of my mom’s favorite dinners at the various Mexican 
                restaurants we would patronize. The Los Cucos quesadillas were a little thicker and 
                shorter—made by folding the tortilla on top of itself, then cutting the half circle into 
                three pieces. At Lupe Tortilla, they made tortillas double the size of the average, so the 
                quesadillas came out a little longer, and the tortilla bubbles would brown from being fried 
                in oil. Las Mananitas has hands down the best cheese quesadillas, though. Is it because 
                they’re made with a little extra oil? Is it because they’re served by the wonderful family 
                that runs the business? Is it the darker interior of the dining establishment despite the 
                extra large windows decorated with kitschy, thick-outlined drawings celebrating whatever 
                holiday is next? Taste and ambiance are interwoven so tightly here and in most Tex Mex 
                restaurants, I argue.</p>
            <p>Lupe Tortilla is where my mom and dad had their first date c. 1994. We have visited that 
                restaurant, that building and those chairs, so many times over the years. I often wonder 
                if mom and dad think about their first date when we go almost 30 years later as a fully 
                grown family. We were frequent patrons of Las Man and Los Cucos throughout my childhood 
                as well, taking our grandparents–or any out of town visitor–to the best places to eat in 
                town.</p>

        <h2>Just Because It's Cold Doesn't Make It Bad</h2>
            <p>Mom’s favorite thing to do is eat half the quesadillas at dinner, box them up and eat the second 
                half the next day for lunch. (As a lifelong educator, not having to prepare a lunch for the 
                school day was always a plus, and they taste just as good the second day.) There will always 
                be the classic argument: pro or against heating up leftovers. I encourage you, reader, to refrain 
                from placing those Day Two quesadillas into your shitty microwave.</p> 
            <p>The cold cheese and the slightly chewier tortilla combo make for a delightful next-day snack 
                or lunch. Even if there are beans and rice with your leftovers, don’t feel the need to warm up 
                just the sides, either. Try it all a little colder–it might surprise you.</p>
        <h2>The (Humble) Quesadilla</h2>
            <p>Now, there is a huge debate in the food community on how to categorize the foods we eat. This debate 
                has been the source of many memes: is a hot dog a sandwich? Is cereal soup? The list goes on. I decided to 
                include the quesadilla in my cheese sandwich website because it is one. Two pieces of bread on either side 
                of delicious cheese in the middle. To most, the quesadilla is the Latinx equivalent of the grilled cheese. To this 
                end, I could have also included other items that match this definition such as a bagel with cream cheese. Branching 
                into closed items, mentioning perogis, empanadas, gyros, dumplings--all can be made to feature cheese in between dough.

        <h2 id="recipe">The Recipe</h2>
            <h3>What You Need:</h3>
                <p>Two tortillas; shredded cheese; butter, oil, or mayonnaise if you’re freaky</p>
            <h3>How To:</h3>
                <p>Melt ½ tablespoon butter on a skillet over medium heat. Place one tortilla on the hot skillet. 
                    Sprinkle cheese on top of the tortilla, then place the second tortilla on top of the cheese. 
                    Leave to cook for a few minutes. When the bottom side of the quesadilla has browned slightly, 
                    flip the entire quesadilla over and cook the other side. When both sides are looking cooked, 
                    remove the quesadilla from heat. Cut the quesadilla into quarters and serve it with rice and 
                    beans to the blonde gringa at table eight.</p>
