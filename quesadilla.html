        <h2>Thanks Be to Cumin</h2>
        <p>There are two defining features of a childhood in south Texas. One is the heat—and not 
            just heat, but humid heat—the kind of heat that soaks your skin with warmth and salty 
            sweat. I never had to worry about dry hands or forgetting a jacket (unless we were 
            headed to the library or the movie theater—somewhere inside where the air conditioning 
            was always on full blast). This (sometimes) wretched heat inspired many lemonade 
            stands, car washes, and afternoons inside.

            The second absolute of a Texan childhood is Tex Mex. There’s over 12,000 restaurants 
            in Houston, Texas these days and I’m willing to bet at least half of them serve Tex Mex. 
            Now, the phrase Tex Mex is controversial: no one really knows exactly what it means. 
            According to some, Tex Mex encompasses all Mexican food made in the United States from 
            California to Arizona to Texas. For others, Tex Mex is only Mexican food made in Texas, 
            by Texans and Tejanos. 
            
            By definition, Tex Mex has a key ingredient Mexican food does not: the peppery, smokey, 
            slightly nutty taste of cumin. Fajitas, nachos, brisket and beef enchiladas, ground beef 
            street tacos, yellow cheese; these are the makings of Tex Mex, as well as a big splash 
            of oil to cook everything in, of course.
            
            Although cumin is embedded into these dishes, cumin is usually not found in my all-time 
            favorite, Tex Mex staple: the cheese quesadilla. This Mexican cheese sandwich is flavored 
            solely by the thick, yellow cheese in the middle and the oil-soaked tortillas that flank 
            it. Not only good as an appetizer or cold from the fridge the next morning, I argue cheese 
            quesadillas make an excellent entree.</p>
        <h2>Tex Mex Home</h2>
        <p>For years, cheese quesadillas were one of my mom’s favorite dinners at the various Mexican 
            restaurants we would patronize. The Los Cucos quesadillas were a little thicker and 
            shorter—made by folding the tortilla on top of itself, then cutting the half circle into 
            three pieces. At Lupe Tortilla, they made tortillas double the size of the average, so the 
            quesadillas came out a little longer, and the tortilla bubbles would brown from being fried 
            in oil. Las Mananitas has hands down the best cheese quesadillas, though. Is it because 
            they’re made with a little extra oil? Is it because they’re served by the wonderful family 
            that runs the business? Is it the darker interior of the dining establishment despite the 
            extra large windows decorated with kitschy, thick-outlined drawings celebrating whatever 
            holiday is next? Taste and ambiance are interwoven so tightly here and in most Tex Mex 
            restaurants, I argue. 

            Lupe Tortilla is where my mom and dad had their first date c. 1994. We have visited that 
            restaurant, that building and those chairs, so many times over the years. I often wonder 
            if mom and dad think about their first date when we go almost 30 years later as a fully 
            grown family. We were frequent patrons of Las Man and Los Cucos throughout my childhood 
            as well, taking our grandparents–or any out of town visitor–to the best places to eat in 
            town.</p>
        <h2>Just Because It's Cold Doesn't Make It Bad</h2>
        <p>Mom’s favorite thing to do is eat half the quesadillas at dinner, box them up and eat the second 
            half the next day for lunch. (As a lifelong educator, not having to prepare a lunch for the 
            school day was always a plus, and they taste just as good the second day.) There will always 
            be the classic argument: pro or against heating up leftovers. I encourage you, reader, to refrain 
            from placing those Day Two quesadillas into your shitty microwave. 

            The cold cheese and the slightly tougher tortilla combo make for a delightful next-day snack 
            or lunch. Even if there are beans and rice with your leftovers, don’t feel the need to warm up 
            just the sides, either. Try it all a little colder–it might surprise you.</p>
