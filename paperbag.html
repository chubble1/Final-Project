        <h1 id="article-title">An Emergency Lunch</h1>
            <h2>A Public Education</h2>
                <p>I was in elementary school when I encountered my first cheese sandwich. Before this, I didn’t know 
                sandwiches could come with only cheese in the middle. I knew peanut butter and jellies. I knew 
                turkey sandwiches, featuring cheese, mustard, mayo, and cold cuts. I knew of Subway. But I never 
                knew a sandwich could just be two slices of bread and one slice of cheese.</p>
                <p>My parents had never made me a grilled cheese—in fact, the first grilled cheese I ate was the 
                entree of the $1.75 school lunch I would buy every day of my elementary school life. I was introduced 
                to many foods on the bright, red lunch trays. Examples include the always tasty, mildly sweet 
                mozzarella sticks—served with the one-inch plastic containers of even sweeter marinara sauce—and 
                the scalloped potatoes that came on the side of meals (which also had a slightly sweet flavor to them).</p>
                <p>These school lunches were nothing to write home about. Less than that: they were sometimes horrid. 
                In the early 2000s, before Michelle Obama wanted to build an America of healthy children, less 
                attention was paid to the nutritional value of meals. However, I vividly remember the food groups 
                pyramid printed on glossy posters and hung throughout the cafeteria. These were next to images of 
                children eating healthy foods, and of course the iconic “got milk?” posters featuring my idols: Mary 
                Kate and Ashley Olsen, Houston Rockets players, but not the Britney Spears one because in her 
                poster her midriff showed.</p>
                <p>Health was meant to be on our brains, but it didn’t seem important to the creators of the lunches 
                of my early elementary school days. This was especially evident when in kindergarten I noticed the 
                brown paper bags.</p>
            <h2>A Buck Seventy-Five</h2>
                <p>To pay for school lunch, a parent or guardian had to fill your lunch account with money. They could 
                put as much or as little as they wanted depending on how many meals they wanted their children to 
                eat. My school did serve breakfast, but I only bought lunch at school. Every lunch was $1.75. My 
                lovely dad would fill my lunch account and my three siblings’ enough for many weeks of meals at a 
                time, usually. When the account funds got low for any student, the kind lunch lady checking children 
                out would remind students, “Tell your parents your account needs to be refilled.” It was gentle and 
                it was casual because that’s what happens to accounts: their balance lowers over time.</p>
                <p>The brown paper bag came out when a child could not pay for lunch at all. Either their account was 
                in the negatives or they didn’t have the $1.75 in cash to pay for an entire tray of food. When this 
                happened, the kind lunch lady checking children out turned into a dragon, hoarding food behind the 
                glass of the serving counters. She would take the bright, red tray from the child (sans the carton 
                of milk) and walk it to the back kitchen. On her way back, she grabbed a brown paper bag and gave 
                it to the child.</p>
                <p>Most of the time there were tears. Angry tears and sad tears. Embarrassed tears.</p>
                <p>Inside the brown paper bag sat one item: a cheese sandwich haphazardly covered in plastic wrap. This 
                was not a grilled cheese sandwich. This was not a turkey sandwich. Could we call this a sandwich at 
                all? This was the emergency lunch, given to all children unable to pay for a lunch meal. Everyone 
                knew it, too.</p>
                <p>Even at five years old, we knew the brown paper bag meant you had no money for lunch. And it was 
                easy to spot. In a sea of brightly colored lunch boxes and dishes, of red lunch trays and blue and pink 
                milk cartons, the brown paper bag stood out like the last kid picked for recess kickball.</p>
            <h2>Temporary dread</h2>
                <p>I got the brown paper bag a few times over the course of my K-5 career. The first time it happened, I 
                could not believe it. She said “I have to take this from you,” and there went my bright, red tray. I 
                remember the tears stinging my eyes so well. I remember being five and trying not to look any of my 
                classmates in the eye: I didn’t want to see their faces of pity and I really didn’t want to see their 
                made at home lunches with on-brand Oreos and Uncrustables. I didn’t want Mary Kate and Ashley’s perfect 
                poster eyes to see my sad face as I unwrapped the cheese sandwich. How could my father have betrayed me 
                like this? He would never forget to put money in my account: was it on purpose? Did he not want me 
                eating the tiny hamburger, fruit salad, and happy face French fries that were served that day? Did I 
                do something wrong?</p>
                <p>And the sandwich sucked. In second grade, my friend Corey got a brown paper bag. She had a few tears 
                in her eyes, because it didn’t matter how old you were—it hurt every time you couldn’t get the meal 
                described daily on the morning announcements. Through her frustration she joked about the bread being 
                horrible, which it was, and the cheese rubbery enough to roll into a ball and bounce, which you probably 
                could do.</p> 
                <p>I realize my privilege here, of course, of only having to survive the brown paper bag a handful of times. 
                I remember some students getting a brown paper bag once or twice a week, every week. I remember the 
                students who already knew there was nothing in their account, going up and down the lunch line asking 
                us to pay for a tray to avoid the brown paper bag. This was elementary school and even then I remember 
                wondering why these kids—my friends—were not being fed when there was obviously so much food in the kitchen 
                of our cafeteria.</p>           
                <p>Dad had forgotten. It wasn’t because I was a bad child that I received the brown paper bag. It was simply 
                because he was a human who forgot to do one single task. And honestly, I blame way more people than my dad 
                for making me feel that bad about a cheese sandwich.</p>
            <h2>The Recipe</h2>
                <h3>What You Need:</h3>
                    <p>Two pieces of whole wheat bread; one slice of American cheese</p>
                <h3>How To:</h3>
                    <p>Place two pieces of bread next to each other on a plate. Lay the American cheese on top of one of the 
                    bread pieces. Close the sandwich with the second piece of bread. Wrap the sandwich with plastic wrap, 
                    and place in a brown paper bag. Give to the child with tears in her eyes, after letting her know her 
                    lunch account was in the negatives.</p>
