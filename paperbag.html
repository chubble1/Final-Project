            <h1>An Emergency Lunch</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>A Public Education</h2>
        <p>I was in elementary school when I encountered my first cheese sandwich. Before this, I didn’t know 
            sandwiches could come with only cheese in the middle. I knew peanut butter and jellies. I knew 
            turkey sandwiches, featuring cheese, mustard, mayo, and cold cuts. I knew of Subway. But I never 
            knew a sandwich could just be two slices of bread and one slice of cheese.

            My parents had never made me a grilled cheese—in fact, the first grilled cheese I ate was the 
            entree of the $1.75 school lunch I would buy every day of my elementary school life. I was introduced 
            to many foods on the bright, red lunch trays. Examples include the always tasty, mildly sweet 
            mozzarella sticks—served with the one-inch plastic containers of even sweeter marinara sauce—and 
            the scalloped potatoes that came on the side of meals (which also had a slightly sweet flavor to them).
            
            These school lunches were nothing to write home about. Less than that: they were sometimes horrid. 
            In the early 2000s, before Michelle Obama wanted to build an America of healthy children, less 
            attention was paid to the nutritional value of meals. However, I vividly remember the food groups 
            pyramid printed on glossy posters and hung throughout the cafeteria. These were next to images of 
            children eating healthy foods, and of course the iconic “got milk?” posters featuring my idols: Mary 
            Kate and Ashley Olsen, Houston Rockets players, but not the Britney Spears one because in her 
            poster her midriff showed.  
            
            Health was meant to be on our brains, but it didn’t seem important to the creators of the lunches 
            of my early elementary school days. This was especially evident when in kindergarten I noticed the 
            brown paper bags.</p>
        <h2>A Buck Seventy-Five</h2>
        <p>To pay for school lunch, a parent or guardian had to fill your lunch account with money. They could 
            put as much or as little as they wanted depending on how many meals they wanted their children to 
            eat. My school did serve breakfast, but I only bought lunch at school. Every lunch was $1.75. My 
            lovely dad would fill my lunch account and my three siblings’ enough for many weeks of meals at a 
            time, usually. When the account funds got low for any student, the kind lunch lady checking children 
            out would remind students, “Tell your parents your account needs to be refilled.” It was gentle and 
            it was casual because that’s what happens to accounts: their balance lowers over time.

            The brown paper bag came out when a child could not pay for lunch at all. Either their account was 
            in the negatives or they didn’t have the $1.75 in cash to pay for an entire tray of food. When this 
            happened, the kind lunch lady checking children out turned into a dragon, hoarding food behind the 
            glass of the serving counters. She would take the bright, red tray from the child (sans the carton 
            of milk) and walk it to the back kitchen. On her way back, she grabbed a brown paper bag and gave 
            it to the child.
                
            Most of the time there were tears. Angry tears and sad tears. Embarrassed tears. 
                
            Inside the brown paper bag sat one item: a cheese sandwich haphazardly covered in plastic wrap. This 
            was not a grilled cheese sandwich. This was not a turkey sandwich. Could we call this a sandwich at 
            all? This was the emergency lunch, given to all children unable to pay for a lunch meal. Everyone 
            knew it, too. 
                
            Even at five years old, we knew the brown paper bag meant you had no money for lunch. And it was 
            easy to spot. In a sea of brightly colored lunch boxes and dishes, of red lunch trays and blue and pink 
            milk cartons, the brown paper bag stood out like the last kid picked for recess kickball.</p>
        <h2>Temporary dread</h2>
        <p>I got the brown paper bag a few times over the course of my K-5 career. The first time it happened, I 
            could not believe it. She said “I have to take this from you,” and there went my bright, red tray. I 
            remember the tears stinging my eyes so well. I remember being five and trying not to look any of my 
            classmates in the eye: I didn’t want to see their faces of pity and I really didn’t want to see their 
            made at home lunches with on-brand Oreos and Uncrustables. I didn’t want Mary Kate and Ashley’s perfect 
            poster eyes to see my sad face as I unwrapped the cheese sandwich. How could my father have betrayed me 
            like this? He would never forget to put money in my account: was it on purpose? Did he not want me 
            eating the tiny hamburger, fruit salad, and happy face French fries that were served that day? Did I 
            do something wrong?

            And the sandwich sucked. In second grade, my friend Corey got a brown paper bag. She had a few tears 
            in her eyes, because it didn’t matter how old you were—it hurt every time you couldn’t get the meal 
            described daily on the morning announcements. Through her frustration she joked about the bread being 
            horrible, which it was, and the cheese rubbery enough to roll into a ball and bounce, which you probably 
            could do. 
            
            I realize my privilege here, of course, of only having to survive the brown paper bag a handful of times. 
            I remember some students getting a brown paper bag once or twice a week, every week. I remember the 
            students who already knew there was nothing in their account, going up and down the lunch line asking 
            us to pay for a tray to avoid the brown paper bag. This was elementary school and even then I remember 
            wondering why these kids—my friends—were not being fed when there was obviously so much food in the kitchen 
            of our cafeteria. 
            
            Dad had forgotten. It wasn’t because I was a bad child that I received the brown paper bag. It was simply 
            because he was a human who forgot to do one single task. And honestly, I blame way more people than my dad 
            for making me feel that bad about a cheese sandwich.</p>
