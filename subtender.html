                <h2>Comes With the Territory</h2>
                    <p>We moved to Forest Park in August 2022. My boyfriend and I packed up our two kitties, 
                    our king bed, our collection of about 500 books and moved into a one bedroom apartment 
                    far smaller than the three bedroom house we were renting in Houston, Texas. Upon arriving 
                    at the apartment, which we virtually walked through via FaceTime and paid for before we 
                    saw it in person, we noticed many little things we didn’t like. The living room crown molding 
                    isn't aligned. The gasket is falling off the back door. Don’t even get me started on the 
                    squeaking floors, which seem to get louder every time I walk down the hall.</p>
                    <p>For all of its faults, it is redeemed by one, single business that’s across the street from 
                    our front door: The Submarine Tender. There is no history of the building or the business 
                    (or the beautiful subs they create) available online. In fact, the only article I found 
                    regarding the business history is an article saying the restaurant is at least 30 years 
                    old. That article was published in 2012, so add roughly a decade: the Submarine Tender is 
                    at least 40. The same article says there were more locations at one point, too. After a 
                    simple Google Maps search though, it’s easy to tell the information is outdated. My 
                    Submarine Tender is the only one that exists.</p>

                    <figcaption>The Regular Cheese, about 6 inches in length.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                    <p>The inside of the restaurant looks exactly how one might imagine a 40 year old sandiwch shop to look.
                    Roughly 12 booths line the windows and walls against white tile. On the walls are two huge murals. The murals, which
                    look to be painted directly onto the wall despite the frames that surround them, are of Greek beaches with dark blue water 
                    surrounded by lush, green mountains that are speckled with the iconic, white buildings of Greece. On the other side of 
                    the sandwhich counter, everything is wood: medium brown panels line the walls. The walls on the employee side are covered in 
                    photos of school basketball teams, a Bears game tracker, and the giant, dimly-lit menu that wraps around three of the four walls.</p>
                <h2><i>SUB</i>title</h2>
                    <p>The simultaneously over/underwhelming menu has gyros, butter garlic french fries, shakes and fountain drinks, calzone-esque pizza foldovers, 
                    and every sub a meat eater or vegetarian could want. The sizes are Regular, King, and Super. Although I only go for the 
                    lowly Regular Cheese, I do dream of Super Cheeses. Of course they cater as well: a whole tub of sandwiches cut into 4 inch chunks.</p>
                    <p>The employees are always nice and cordial and depending on the time of day, a little bit stoned. Sometimes the owners are there--or maybe 
                    it's just who I assume is the owner (but he's speaking Greek and definitely hired his sons/nephews because they look exactly alike). 
                    I really apprecaite how I never feel judged when I order my cheese. Sometimes I cringe to myself because I know a fellow patron 
                    overhears me ordering a cheese sandwich in a place stocked with all types of meat.</p>
                <figure class="section-image even">

                <h2>Home is Where the Cheese Sandwich Is</h2>
                    <p>Honeslty it's a bit difficult to describe the sandwich's taste besides: it tastes like a cheese sub. The bread is soft and springy on the inside and a bit 
                    tougher on the outside. Sesame seeds grace the top of the bread, which gets cut long ways then opened. I've watched the sandwich makers every time. For the cheese, they 
                    go bread oil first, then they lay the cold, deeply creamy American cheese down. (The cheese gets 2 extra slides, in place of the meats they would put on 
                    any other sub.) Then, rapid fire: the shredded lettuce, chopped onion, and cut tomatoes are placed gently onto the bread. Biting into the finished product 
                    is a dream. The seasonings and the bread oil bring it all together for me, blowing the Subway sandwiches of my youth out of the water.</p>
                    <p>The best experience is coming home from a long day and picking up a few subs for my boyfriend and myself. Not only is the walk extremely 
                    short--necessary for when the <i>real</i> Chicago winter months kick in--but the food is warm, the food is delicious, and it means I don't have to cook when 
                    I'm beat. I'm really happy to have a beloved food establishment so close by. I am really happy to be eating a sandwich that is well made and 
                    tasty.</p>
                <h2 id="recipe">The Recipe</h2>
                    <h3>What You Need:</h3>
                    <p>One of the freshest sub rolls you can find, sesame seeds on top; six slices of White American cheese; two slices of tomato; 
                    lettuce; Onions, cut into strips; special bread oil (for 2.99 you can take your own 4 oz bottle of bread oil home!)</p>
                    <h3>How To:</h3>
                    <p>Cut an opening on one of the sides of the bread. Open the bread to construct the sandwich. Douse both sides of the (now) open bread 
                    with oil. Evenly place the lettuce, then onion, then tomato onto the bread. Top with the star of the show: the cheese, then close 
                    the bread. Move the sandwich onto a sheet of paper, then cut the sandwich in two. Wrap the two pieces together, forming one, long 
                    sub and place it in a brown paper bag. Hand to the customer you see once a week.</p>
