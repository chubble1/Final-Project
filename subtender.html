        <h2>Comes With the Territory</h2>
            <p>We moved to Forest Park in August 2022. My boyfriend and I packed up our two kitties, 
                our king bed, our collection of about 500 books and moved into a one bedroom apartment 
                far smaller than the three bedroom house we were renting in Houston, Texas. Upon arriving 
                at the apartment, which we virtually walked through via FaceTime and paid for before we 
                saw it in person, we noticed many little things we didn’t like. The living room crown molding 
                isn't aligned. The gasket is falling off the back door. Don’t even get me started on the 
                squeaking floors, which seem to get louder every time I walk down the hall.</p>
            <p>For all of its faults, it is redeemed by one, single business that’s across the street from 
                our front door: The Submarine Tender. There is no history of the building or the business 
                (or the beautiful subs they create) available online. In fact, the only article I found 
                regarding the business history is an article saying the restaurant is at least 30 years 
                old. That article was published in 2012, so add roughly a decade: the Submarine Tender is 
                at least 40. The same article says there were more locations at one point, too. After a 
                simple Google Maps search though, it’s easy to tell the information is outdated. My 
                Submarine Tender is the only one that exists.
