                <h2>The Vegetarian's Dilemma</h2>
                    <p>When I became a vegetarian on January 1, 2017, I knew I would miss a few important meats in my life.
                    I tell people all the time: the one meat I miss most is a hot dog. Before the veggie conversion, I 
                    thought for sure my most missed item would be a hamburger, but there is nothing like a hot dog.</p>
                    <p>Even when I was eating meat, I was never into cold cuts or subs like other people were. The New 
                    Englanders have subs, hoagies, heroes, Italians, grinders--can't forget a Boston spuckie. If you're 
                    from Louisiana, it's a poboy. If you're from Texas, you get Subway and that's pretty much it.<fn value="1">If 
                    you're in Houston, there might be a poboy place due to the New Orleans being so close in proximity.
                    </fn> Although my family frequented Subways throughout my youth, I was not a die hard fan. In fact, I 
                    did not look forward to eating the turkey and white American cheese or light mustard and mayo that would
                    sit atop my sandwich's inards.</p>
                    <p>Unforunately, there were lots of times from my childhood where I was not happy with what I was eating. What I really
                    mean by that is I was not eating foods that brought me joy: whether it was my dad's dry pork chops we would 
                    be forced to injest once a week or the 100-calorie packs of Oreo Thins that mom would stock the pantry with.
                    This is not a slight at my parents though. They did what they could with the resources they had.</p>
                    <p>I remember my mom often saying <q>I just don't have the time or patience to cook like my mom used to.</q> Her mom, 
                    a living, breathing housewife and educator of the 50s, would cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Of course my 
                    mom, a woman with four children in the Do-It-All era, who has worked 50-60 hour weeks my whole life, does not have the time
                    or patience to cook her family 3 meals a day. After my youngest brother started kindergarten, my mom went back to work after 
                    taking some time (5ish years) off to raise four babies. This was the beginning of my dad's stay-at-home-parent career.</p>
                    <p>My father, a true Baby Boomer born in 1949, remembers a poorer childhood than my mom. His food stories are filled of a family
                    excited to have enough resources to make a birthday cake or Thanksgiving dinner. Again, though, he too had a mother who 
                    cooked everything--and did it so well! If you ask him about Grandma Hubble's buckeyes or roasts, he won't stop talking 
                    for a minute.</p>
